# Package Sim
This is a JavaFX application done in a university OOP course.
Program uses Google Maps to draw coordinates for postal pickup points.
Pickup points can be added manually or loaded from Posti.

## TODO
Actual package simulation part is unfinished.
Program is bit old so it does not function as it should.
