# Package Sim
This is a JavaFX application done in a university OOP course.
Program uses Google Maps to draw coordinates for postal pickup points.
Pickup points can be added manually or loaded from Posti.

## TODO
Actual package simulation part is unfinished.
Cannot be build (and probably not run) other operating system the Archlinux.
Program is bit old so it does not function as it should.
