# Package Sim
This is a JavaFX application done in a university OOP course.
Program uses Google Maps to draw coordinates for postal pickup points.
Pickup points can be added manually or loaded from Posti.

Or at least used to. When code was done Google maps didn't need API key.
API key seem to require a payment account. I do not want to sign on with
Google just because this project.

Posti has also change it server behavior so that there is a bug that pickup points CML gives
404 eventhough browser opens XML (at time of writing).

## TODO
- Actual package simulation part is unfinished.
- Cannot be build (and probably not run) other operating system the Archlinux.
- Program is bit old so it does not function as it should.
- Pickup point loader fix.
